## Why?
I've had a lot of people come up to me tell me that they want to learn how to code. The one thing most, if not all, of them share in common is that they seldom know where and/or how to start. Learning to code goes well beyond simply learning how to write it. There needs to be a purpose; a reason for which you want to learn the skill(s).

Now, the reason(s) needn't be a complex conclusion drawn from philosophical origins. But it should come from a natural interest, rather than to satisfy a superficial purpose (i.e. simply wanting to add it to your resume). Having a sincere passion to learn something makes the process significantly easier and more efficient.

So before you start hammering out code, ask yourself. *Why* do I want to code?

*Remember, this should be something you WANT to do, not something you have to do*

## Where Should I start?
There are dozens of online tutorial services that can help you start coding, so finding one in general isn't the the difficult part. The hard part is finding the *right* one. Depending on your learning style, try finding resources that work for *YOU*. Many people tend to fixate themselves on just one method, thereby doing themselves a disservice. Learning something like programming cannot be done in such a linear fashion. To get the most out of the learning experience, you will need to mix and match different learning methods. This serves several purposes:
- You will be able to pick up on key concepts faster by seeing them implemented in different scenarios
- It will help improve your understanding of the concept if you are able to see it through multiple perspectives
- You will find that you aren't bored as quickly
