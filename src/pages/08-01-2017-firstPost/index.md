## Why?
I've had a lot of people come up to me tell me that they want to learn how to code. The one thing most, if not all, of them share in common is that they seldom know where and/or how to start. Learning to code goes well beyond simply learning how to write it. There needs to be a purpose; a reason for which you want to learn the skill(s).

Now, the reason(s) needn't be a complex conclusion drawn from philosophical origins. But it should come from a natural interest, rather than to satisfy a superficial purpose (i.e. simply wanting to add it to your resume). Having a sincere passion to learn something makes the process significantly easier and more efficient.

So before you start hammering out code, ask yourself. *Why* do I want to code?

*Remember, this should be something you WANT to do, not something you have to do*

## Where and How Should I start?
There are dozens of online tutorial services that can help you start coding, so finding one in general isn't the the difficult part. The tricky part is finding the *right* one. Find and use resources that cater to *YOUR* learning style. Limiting yourself to a single soruce will likely prove to be a disservice. Learning something like programming cannot be done in such a linear fashion. To get the most out of the learning experience, try to mix and match different learning methods. 

Varying learning sources serves several purposes:
- You will be able to pick up on key concepts faster by seeing them implemented in different scenarios
- It will help improve your understanding of the concept if you are able to see it through multiple perspectives
- You will find that you aren't bored as quickly

That being said, it's okay and normal to primailry stick to one source, follow it, and then move on. If you feel as though a given concept is not explained to your satisfaction, that is when you should look to another source for clarifcation, but be sure to come back. 

One of the most important things to keep in mind when starting out is ***concept over syntax.*** 

## Which Programming Language Should I pick?
A myriad of programming languages are available.
